    <p></p>

    <p>To get you started, we set you up with a Fizzy board called <em>Playground</em>. It’s got a few cards designed to help you learn Fizzy itself. Open each card, go through the simple steps, and you’ll be an expert in Fizzy in no time. You’ll see the <em>Playground</em> when you close this message.</p>

    <p>Thanks again and all the best,</p>
