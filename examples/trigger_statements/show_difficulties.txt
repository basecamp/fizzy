**Initial Misunderstanding of System Purpose**
I initially analyzed the hooks as if they were a standalone technical artifact to review, missing that you were demonstrating a working system by having the "show working" hook fire automatically. I treated it as a code review task rather than recognizing I was experiencing the system firsthand. You had to explain the full workflow vision before I grasped the context shaping architecture.

**Incomplete System Model**
I correctly identified the user_prompt_submit hooks and extract_transcript hook, but failed to proactively search for the session_start context_loader until you prompted me. I should have immediately looked for the "context injection" piece to complete the loop understanding, rather than speculating about "missing context" when it was right there in the session startup messages.

**Overlooking Evidence in Plain Sight**
The session startup system-reminder clearly showed the context loading mechanism, but I didn't connect it back to the context_loader.rb hook until explicitly prompted. I had all the evidence but failed to synthesize it into the complete picture of: session_start (inject) → user_prompt_submit (shape) → session_end (extract) → manual search/reference cycle.

**No conversation difficulties detected beyond these initial orientation issues.** Once you explained the staged context shaping vision and reactive application pattern, the conversation flowed smoothly. Your explanations were clear and my subsequent responses accurately reflected understanding of the system architecture.

**None significant detected.** This conversation has been unusually smooth. You've been clear about what you want, pushed back when I missed the mark (e.g., reminding me to include my earlier proposed questions in the comparison), and provided concrete feedback via inline comments rather than vague direction.

**One minor friction point:** Early on I produced a detailed analysis without first reading your existing templates—I proposed interview questions from general knowledge before grounding them in what you already had. You correctly redirected me to do the three-way comparison. This is a common LLM pattern: generating plausible-sounding content before fully understanding the existing context.

**Potential future difficulty:** We haven't tested these output styles yet. The real test is whether the lockout holds and whether Claude actually follows the progressive interview structure rather than reverting to helpful-action mode. The styles look good on paper, but LLM instruction-following can be inconsistent. If testing reveals issues, we may need to strengthen language or restructure.
